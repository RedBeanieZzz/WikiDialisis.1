# WikiDialisis
WikiDialisis is a simple and easy to manage dialisys page that contains all the information about Pre-transplant and transplant care methods, suggested diets, tips and considerations when you are an active hemodialisys patient or transplanted person, labs close to you, hemodialisis centers, hospitals and clinics, accomodations, and more!

It is focused on bringing precise information mixed with EASY navigation favoring senior citizens.
Will be available only in argentina (for now...).

| Here is the landing page for phones and a premodel of the first view |

The Project consist in an informative web page that gives the information directely from patients and doctors to the user.
With a blog for them to chat and give other opinions and tips to each other (like, how to manage dead times while in dialisys;
or what you cannot eat while doing certain medical studies)
